    <h2>Let's explain it here:</h2>
    <p>An iced latte is a cold, creamy coffee drink made with shots of espresso, cold milk, and ice, often with added flavorings like vanilla or caramel, offering a smoother, milder taste than regular iced coffee because of the milk-to-espresso ratio. It's essentially a traditional latte served chilled and is a popular alternative to hot coffee, providing a balanced, rich flavor perfect for warmer weather.</p>
