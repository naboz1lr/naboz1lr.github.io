            <img src="img/Sardine.jpg"> 
            <p>The sardine booklet was made in my freshman (technically sophmore) year of college in my typography class. The Page shown is one of my favorites from the booklet about typography in the real world.</p>

            <h3>Iron Maiden Laser Cut</h3>
            <img src="img/EddieIM.jpg"> 
            <p>The assignment was to find pre made vectors on the internet and break them down so that the laser cutter can understand how to cut it out. I chose eddie from Iron maiden that I found at a <a href="https://readytocut.com/threads/eddie-iron-maiden-updated.3727/">laser cutter template website.</a> It came out very cool and makes a great addition to my wall.</p>

            <p>During my web design 1 class we were tasked with creating a app with a partner. The whole semester walked us through the whole process of UI/UX design and all. This project stands out to me as UI/UX design/product design is what I aspire to do as a career.</p>
